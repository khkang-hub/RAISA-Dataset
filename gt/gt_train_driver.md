# Driver GT Sentences (Scenario-level)

## Daytime (clear weather)
- Maintain the train’s speed within the permitted limits and follow normal operating procedures. Keep continuous lookout for signals, track conditions, and any unexpected hazards ahead. Be prepared to brake promptly if any abnormal situation is detected, and if needed, notify the control center.

## Nighttime (clear weather)
- Verify that headlights and cab visibility-related equipment are functioning properly before and during operation. Keep heightened vigilance for signals, track changes, and potential hazards due to reduced visibility at night. Maintain a safe speed within the limits and be ready to brake immediately, and if needed, notify the control center.

## Tunnel driving
- Maintain the train’s speed within the tunnel speed limit and closely monitor signal indications and track conditions. Pay attention to visibility changes and keep the train under stable control to ensure sufficient stopping margin. If needed, contact the control center and be prepared to respond to emergencies.

## Railway signal ahead
- Observe the upcoming signal aspect early and continuously while approaching. Adjust speed in advance and be prepared to stop before the signal if required. If needed, notify the control center if any abnormal signal behavior or uncertainty occurs.

## Approaching platform
- Reduce speed according to the station approach profile and prepare for a precise stop at the designated stopping position. Monitor the platform area and ensure safe boarding and alighting conditions during the approach and stop. If needed, contact the control center if any safety issue or abnormal situation arises.

## Foggy weather
- Recognize reduced visibility and operate with increased caution under foggy conditions. Reduce speed to maintain sufficient stopping distance and closely monitor signals and track conditions. Use the horn as required by operating practice, and if needed, notify the control center.

## Rainy weather
- Recognize wet-rail conditions and operate with increased caution under rainy weather. Reduce speed as needed and apply braking smoothly with sufficient margin to prevent wheel slip and extended stopping distance. Monitor for any abnormal conditions, and if needed, notify the control center.

## Snowy weather
- Recognize snowy and low-adhesion conditions and operate with increased caution. Reduce speed as needed and avoid sudden acceleration or harsh braking to prevent slipping and maintain stable control. Monitor for abnormalities, and if needed, notify the control center.

## Obstacle
- Apply emergency brakes to slow down the train. Prepare to stop the train if necessary to ensure safety. Inform the control center about the track.
